## Welcome to EmoPain Challenge 2019

In this challenge, we aim to attract the interest of a large audience of researchers working on body movement and muscle activity 
analysis, and to move the attention of the machine learning community beyond computer vision based approaches (as a means of movement 
analysis) to motion capture data from wearable devices. The latter is critical and timely as wearable devices are increasingly being 
used to ubiquitously support wellbeing. We also aim to attract more the ubiquitous computing researchers to collaborate with the ACII 
community in tackling the critical problem of pain management [Aung et al. 2016b](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7173007). 

For this reason, the workshop will invite research papers on detection of pain and related states, pain behaviour analysis, and clinical applications of related systems with the expected outcome of
<br>
- Increasing the number of researchers working in the area of pain and related behaviour analysis and recognition;
- Improving automatic recognition performance for pain level, self-efficacy, and protective behaviour; 
- Extending the network of researchers working on body movement analysis beyond ACII.

### Challenge Description


### Dataset


### Participate


### Paper Submission

Paper will be submitted through EasyChair(Link is coming soon).
<br>
We are expecting at least 20 submissions and we plan a 50% acceptance rate. 
<br>
We have received many requests for access to the EmoPain dataset and this challenge is an opportunity to open it. 
<br>
Paper length will be up to 7 pages (6 pages + 1 page for references). 
The reviewing process will be double blind.

### Keynote Speakers

#### [Professor Rebecca Slater, Oxford University, UK (tentative)](https://www.paediatrics.ox.ac.uk/team/rebeccah-slater)

#### [Professor Chris Eccleston, University of Bath, UK (tentative)](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/chris-eccleston)
<br>
We also aim to have a multidisciplinary panel (in line with the inclusion theme of ACII 2019) on the requirements and challenges from 
real world applications for the above-discussed technology. We hope that the discussion will trigger interest that leads to new 
approaches for developing automatic recognition systems. The panel will be led by a member of the organizing committee (Dr Amanda 
Williams, clinical psychologist and academic expert in pain) and include 2 keynote speakers (see above), a senior physiotherapist (Mr 
Diarmuid Denneny, Pain Management Centre, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust, UK) and an HCI researcher (Dr Aneesha Singh, UCL, with long-term 
research experience with pain patients).
